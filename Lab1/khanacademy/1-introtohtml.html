    <h1>Oh ana</h1>

<p>
    I'll be God<br>
I'll be God,<br> I'll be God,<br> I'll be God today<br>
Hold my head under the bath and breathe away<br>
Slit my wrists and watch that blood evaporate<br>
Being this Godly can't be good for Ana's safety,<br> Ana, hear me

    <strong> Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <em>algebra.</em><br>
     Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
     There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
     And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
     Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
     Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
     Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
     Until one day, you walk.<br>
     One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
     Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
     Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
     This. is. learning.<br>
     It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
     You just don’t get it, yet.
     Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
     are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
     Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
     </p>
     <p>
     You only have to know one thing:<br>
     You can learn anything.
